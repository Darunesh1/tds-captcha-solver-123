# AI-Powered CAPTCHA Solver

## Overview

This project provides an automated solution for solving CAPTCHA challenges presented as image URLs. It leverages advanced AI techniques to interpret and decipher distorted text within CAPTCHA images, making it a valuable tool for tasks requiring automated image-based verification.

## Features

*   **URL-based CAPTCHA Solving:** Accepts a URL pointing to a CAPTCHA image (e.g., `?url=https://.../image.png`) for processing.
*   **Default Sample Handling:** Includes a default attached sample image for immediate testing and demonstration.
*   **AI-driven Recognition:** Utilizes machine learning models for accurate text extraction from CAPTCHA images.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Implements mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid URLs or unresolvable images.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/captcha-solver-123.git
    cd captcha-solver-123
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    *   **With a specific URL:**
        ```bash
        python main.py ?url=https://example.com/path/to/your/captcha.png
        ```
    *   **Using the default sample image:**
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```

The solved CAPTCHA text will be printed to the console.

## Technical Details

This application is built using Python and relies on libraries such as OpenCV for image manipulation and a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., a Convolutional Neural Network - CNN) for optical character recognition (OCR) specifically tailored for CAPTCHA challenges. The core logic involves preprocessing the image (e.g., noise reduction, binarization) before feeding it to the OCR model for text prediction.
